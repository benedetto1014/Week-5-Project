My project is based off a investment interface for students that allows them to see their investment that they make over time. This incorporates a simple input and output of monthly, annual , and number of years that is caculated based on input. The biggest challenge was to get it to both run and be able to have a clean interface at the same time. By creating the clean, functioning interface for the program is what I say is the biggest accomplishment and its what I believe to transfer to future projects. I also made this this program readable by using simple and effective variables and functions.
